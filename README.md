<p><strong>Heroin Valley:</strong> My master’s project is narrative text story that explores treatment options for heroin users in a small rural California town in Kern County. </p>
<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Visualize the lack of treatment options. </p>
<p><strong>Data:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>Buprenorphine physician locator <a href="/http://www.samhsa.gov/medication-assisted-treatment/physician-program-data/treatment-physician-locator">data set</a>. </li><li>Methadone clinic location. Small data set on the California Department of Healthcare Service website. </li></ul>
<p>Basically I want to show how many doctors prescribe buprenorphine in and around Kern County and how far they are located from the Kern River Valley, my area of interest. I want to do the same thing with methadone clinics. </p>
<p>I think using tableau to create a map would be cool. Somehow hone in the distance people would have to travel and make clear that there aren’t too many of these doctors and clinics. </p>
<p>I also have some overdose death data and making a per capita chart could really emphasize the high overdose death rate in the rural community. Even using per capita, is it ok to compare an area of 12,000 to a county wide population of 800,000? </p>
